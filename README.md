# ReqRes Users App

  

## Installation: ```git clone, npm i```
To start the app on localhost:3000  ```npm start``` in the root of the project.


### Goal

The goal of this project was to create an app that allows you to ineract with [Reqres API](https://%20reqres.in/).

  ### Note
  The api is "fake"; the requests sent to it just get immediately returned to the user and nothing is actually persisted. Login and register is available to select email adresses with irrelevant passowords.
  The tokens that the API returns for logging in users are random strings with and id appended to the end. There is no real auth based on the token or decoding the token. Extracting the appended id was used to simulate auth in order to keep the user logged in.


### Users should be able to:

 - Register
 - Log in / Log out
 - Create new users
 - See all users
 - Edit users
 - Delete users
